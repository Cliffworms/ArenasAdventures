QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                    Good day to you, %pcn, I bid you welcome
<ce>                    to %cn. Your reputation precedes you and
<ce>                    I have need for your talents. I am looking for
<ce>                    an outsider to retrieve something for me. I
<ce>                    promise ample payment if you are successful.
<ce>                    Are you interested in hearing more?
<--->
<ce>                    Welcome to %cn, %pcn. Not my favorite
<ce>                    weather outside. I assure you the beauty of
<ce>                    %cn in the bright summer sunshine are
<ce>                    unsurpassed. On the other hand, I am glad
<ce>                    you arrive, for I am looking for someone of
<ce>                    your talents to retrieve an object for me.
<ce>                    I promise an appropriate award in gold.
<ce>                    Please, allow me to give you the details.
<--->
<ce>                    Welcome to the city of %cn. You have been
<ce>                    expected. Only a few hours ago the palace oracle
<ce>                    made augurs and said only you could retrieve
<ce>                    something of importance to me. Will you hear
<ce>                    more?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                    I understand. There would be some risks in
<ce>                    accepting my quest and that naturally makes
<ce>                    you nervous. Very well, %ra. You will
<ce>                    forgive me if I do not walk you to the door.
<ce>                    Goodbye.
<--->
<ce>                    What a pity. I will have to find another
<ce>                    champion. Good day, %pcn.
<ce>                    I wish you well.
<--->
<ce>                    Well, I am not particularly surprised that you
<ce>                    refuse this possible adventure, for I have
<ce>                    heard that young %ra people like you are
<ce>                    notoriously unambitious. I hope you are able to
<ce>                    do something of some value elsewhere.
<ce>                    Leave me now.
<--->
<ce>                    Very well, I cannot force you to accept my plea.
<ce>                    I hope all goes well on your travels, and you
<ce>                    return to %cn someday. Now, you may go.
<ce>                    I will find someone else eager to help the %rt
<ce>                    and become rich. Fare you well.
<--->
<ce>                    I am disappointed, but I understand that a young
<ce>                    adventurer's schedule is hard to break. I see
<ce>                    you are doing well now. I hope good fortune
<ce>                    smiles upon your efforts...
<--->
<ce>                    I suppose I cannot talk you into it. Perhaps
<ce>                    there is another who will accept the risks
<ce>                    in return for wealth and fame. Farewell, %ra.
<--->
<ce>                    I had hoped you would be interested but there
<ce>                    are others who would gladly welcome the chance
<ce>                    to fill their purses. I thank you but must
<ce>                    turn my attention to other matters. Good luck
<ce>                    on your travels.
<--->
<ce>                    You would deny a pleading member of the
<ce>                    %reg royal family a small request such
<ce>                    as this! Away with you then, for I have
<ce>                    more important matters to consider than
<ce>                    some amateur %ra adventurer. Begone! 

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                    Then you shall be my champion, %pcn.
<ce>                    My friend, I fear for the secession of my
<ce>                    cousin, for ambition is great within this court.
<ce>                    If anything were to happen to me, I shudder at
<ce>                    the fate of %cn. I need you to make a
<ce>                    =timer_ days journey to __location_ to the
<ce>                    %di and back. You will find _dummy_, a
<ce>                    representative of an organization friendly to
<ce>                    %reg in _location_ â€“ %g will have this
<ce>                    _package_ for you. I must have my _package_
<ce>                    in my hands or the consequences may be all too dire.
<ce>                    %reg's rivals will try to stop you if my spies are
<ce>                    correct. They have not been reliable of late. If you
<ce>                    can recover my _package_ from our allies by then, I
<ce>                    promise you _reward_ gold. Be careful, %ra,
<ce>                    and good luck.
<--->
<ce>                    I am happy to make you my champion, %pcn,
<ce>                    but I will be happier still when this business is
<ce>                    behind us. In a philanthropic spirit I now regret,
<ce>                    I loaned our allies  a _package_ that belonged,
<ce>                    I suppose, more to my city than to me. I find I
<ce>                    need to have that _package_ back here as soon
<ce>                    as possible. Our allies have a representative,
<ce>                    _dummy_, waiting for you in, __location_,
<ce>                    which is no more than =timer_ days trip to the %di,
<ce>                    in a place called __location_. I have a lot
<ce>                    of enemies who would like to see me suffer, so you
<ce>                    might encounter some opposing forces. You will have
<ce>                    _reward_ septims if the _package_ is back in
<ce>                    due time. Thank you, %ra, and good luck.
<--->
<ce>                    Excellent, %pcn, you are brave indeed. Some
<ce>                    months ago, for reasons too mired in the muck of
<ce>                    politics to explain, I gave one of %reg's
<ce>                    allies a _package_ of mine. It has become
<ce>                    extremely important to get this _package_
<ce>                    back in %cn. I understand you will find
<ce>                    _dummy_, a representative of our allies in
<ce>                    __location_ which is =timer_ days by horse
<ce>                    to the %di and back. I know not whether the rumors
<ce>                    that our rivals wants to keep the _package_ in
<ce>                    __location_ are true. There could be some
<ce>                    resistance in the way to _location_ in
<ce>                    __location_. I am prepared to offer you
<ce>                    _reward_ gold if that _package_ is here in
<ce>                    the palace. Move quickly, take care of yourself,
<ce>                    and good luck be yours.

<ce>                    The people of %cn may never know what you have done
<ce>                    for them by retrieving my _package_ but I
<ce>                    shall never forget. Take your _reward_ gold and know
<ce>                    that you have the gratitude of %reg's
<ce>                    royal family.
<--->
<ce>                    Ah, you have my _package_. I have to admit I feared
<ce>                    you would not return in time. You have earned your
<ce>                    _reward_ gold pieces, good %ra. I thank you.
<--->
<ce>                    I am glad to see you found my _package_. You
<ce>                    have my thanks for your timely return and the _reward_ septims
<ce>                    I promised you. You will not be soon forgotten in this court.

RumorsDuringQuest:   [1005]
This year's harvest looks like the best ever.
<--->
This year's harvest looks great. There should be a lot of celebrating.
<--->
The good news is that this year's harvest looks as good as last year's.

RumorsPostSuccess:   [1007]
Looks like there was a little scandal at ___questgiver_'s palace. I don't know the details, but, if you can believe, _questgiver_ was nearly deposed because of a misplaced _package_. Things are back to normal.
<--->
I think _questgiver_'s on thin ice. Apparently someone discovered this _package_ was missing and made a big deal about it. Luckily, the %g just produced it. Talk about a ruler with some enemies.
<--->
Well, you know half of __location_'s Circle of Elders is dead thanks to some %ra who brought a _package_ from ___questgiver_ as proof of their complicity to commit treason. Bit of excitement.
<--->
Things have calmed down at __location_'s palace, thank %god. For a while, it looked like the lord and all the family would be executed all because of this missing _package_. Luckily it was returned.
<--->
Thank %god that _package_ was found. _questgiver_ was nearly executed, hadn't you heard?

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
<ce>            Good to see you, %pcn. I was just talking about you to a cousin about how efficient you are.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>            I did not get my _package_ in time, so you will not see your _reward_ gold reward. You may leave in peace, I had considered removing all the veins from your body for inconveniencing me but I changed my mind. I am a fair ruler after all.

<ce>%qdt
I have been hired by _questgiver_ of ___questgiver_ to
recover a _package_ from __location_.
_dummy_, a representative of one of
%reg's allies, will be waiting
for me in _location_. I must have the _package_
in _questgiver_'s hands in =timer_ days or less.

Message: 1020
<ce>            You're here for the _package_, am I right? Here it is. Tell
<ce>            _questgiver_ I said thank you.
<--->
<ce>            Here's the _package_ that _questgiver_ needs. You'd better
<ce>            be on your way back to %g2 now.
<--->
<ce>            _questgiver_ sent you for the _package_? Damn, I could've
<ce>            used it. Well, hurry back to %g2.

Message: 1030
<ce>                    These fighters were obviously sent by
<ce>                    %reg's enemies to stop you, for their
<ce>                    family colors are borne with pride.
<--->
<ce>                    The group blocking your path is at the
<ce>                    service of another. One of
<ce>                    %reg's enemies seem the obvious
<ce>                    master, if they truly wish for your
<ce>                    quest to fail.
<--->
<ce>                    The colors borne by this hostile group
<ce>                    are those of %reg's enemies.
<ce>                    It would seem the rumors of their
<ce>                    interest in aborting your quest are true.
<--->
<ce>                    The occasional wandering band is not an
<ce>                    unusual sight, but one bearing the colors
<ce>                    of %reg's enemies is strange
<ce>                    indeed. It is evident that they really
<ce>                    must want you dead.
<--->
<ce>                    You might assume this to be a chance
<ce>                    encounter with a hostile warrior, but not
<ce>                    one carrying the colors of
<ce>                    %reg's enemies. The rumors of
<ce>                    their involvment in you quest are apparently
<ce>                    true.

Message: 1040
<ce>            _questgiver_ should have received _package_ by now.
<ce>            Knowing you won't get a gold piece for it, you decide
<ce>            to continue on your way.

Message: 1050
<ce>            I thought we had a deal. _reward_ gold for my _package_ back
<ce>            from _dummy_ in =timer_ days. You appear incapable of
<ce>            fulfilling your part, and I would not insult you by explaining
<ce>            why you will receive no reward. Good day, young %ra.
<--->
<ce>            I did not get my _package_ in time, so you will not see your
<ce>            _reward_ gold reward. You may leave in peace, I had considered
<ce>            removing all the veins from your body for inconveniencing me
<ce>            but I changed my mind. I am a fair ruler after all.
<--->
<ce>            Damn you, bastard child of a %ra whore. You have no idea what
<ce>            trouble you have caused by not getting my _package_ on time. If
<ce>            I were the same kind of noble as my predecessor, I would have
<ce>            your lungs removed and eat them. Leave me now, before I am tempted
<ce>            to do just that.
