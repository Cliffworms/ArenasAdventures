QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                    Greetings, %pcn, and welcome to %cn.
<ce>                    If you have come looking for fame and fortune,
<ce>                    I am looking for someone to deliver a package.
<ce>                    Can you lend a hand?
<--->
<ce>                    Yes, I heard of you. You're undoubtedly trying
<ce>                    to make a few gold pieces for yourself.
<ce>                    Normally, I would dismiss you but right now
<ce>                    %reg could use someone of your type to deliver
<ce>                    an important parcel for us.
<--->
<ce>                    Ah, you're %pcn. I will speak with you, for my
<ce>                    city needs help. You must deliver something important.
<ce>                    I have heard you had sufficient experience.
<ce>                    Are you interested?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                    I understand. There would be some risks in
<ce>                    accepting my quest and that naturally makes
<ce>                    you nervous. Very well, %ra. You will
<ce>                    forgive me if I do not walk you to the door.
<ce>                    Goodbye.
<--->
<ce>                    What a pity. I will have to find another
<ce>                    champion. Good day, %pcn.
<ce>                    I wish you well.
<--->
<ce>                    Well, I am not particularly surprised that you
<ce>                    refuse this possible adventure, for I have
<ce>                    heard that young %ra people like you are
<ce>                    notoriously unambitious. I hope you are able to
<ce>                    do something of some value elsewhere.
<ce>                    Leave me now.
<--->
<ce>                    Very well, I cannot force you to accept my plea.
<ce>                    I hope all goes well on your travels, and you
<ce>                    return to %cn someday. Now, you may go.
<ce>                    I will find someone else eager to help the %rt
<ce>                    and become rich. Fare you well.
<--->
<ce>                    I am disappointed, but I understand that a young
<ce>                    adventurer's schedule is hard to break. I see
<ce>                    you are doing well now. I hope good fortune
<ce>                    smiles upon your efforts...
<--->
<ce>                    I suppose I cannot talk you into it. Perhaps
<ce>                    there is another who will accept the risks
<ce>                    in return for wealth and fame. Farewell, %ra.
<--->
<ce>                    I had hoped you would be interested but there
<ce>                    are others who would gladly welcome the chance
<ce>                    to fill their purses. I thank you but must
<ce>                    turn my attention to other matters. Good luck
<ce>                    on your travels.
<--->
<ce>                    You would deny a pleading member of the
<ce>                    %reg royal family a small request such
<ce>                    as this! Away with you then, for I have
<ce>                    more important matters to consider than
<ce>                    some amateur %ra adventurer. Begone! 

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                    Then you shall be my champion, %pcn. Take this
<ce>                    sack to _location_ in __location_ %di of
<ce>                    %cn by =timer_ days. If you do, I can promise you
<ce>                    _reward_ septims from our allies' representative there.
<ce>                    I believe enemies of %reg will try to stop this
<ce>                    shipment, but my council believes otherwise. We agreed
<ce>                    that you should be ready for any encounter. It may be
<ce>                    very dangerous indeed, but you will be _reward_ septims
<ce>                    richer if you reach _location_ before =timer_ days
<ce>                    have passed. Be careful, %ra, and good luck.
<--->
<ce>                    I am happy to make you my champion, %pcn,
<ce>                    but I will be happier still when this business is behind
<ce>                    us. Deliver this sack to _location_ in __location_.
<ce>                    A representative of our allies, a =dummy_
<ce>                    named _dummy_, will be there to reward you with
<ce>                    _reward_ septims. for your trouble. __location_
<ce>                    lies less than =timer_ days journey %di from here. You
<ce>                    must get this vital information to our allies' contact in
<ce>                    _location_ in that time, or it will be worthless.
<ce>                    There are rumors that agents of %reg's enemies
<ce>                    will try to stop you. I would not put much faith in that,
<ce>                    for my enemies are many. Be alert at all times for anyone.
<ce>                    Thank you, %ra, and good luck.
<--->
<ce>                    Excellent, %pcn, you are brave indeed. I need you to
<ce>                    deliver this sack to our allies' representative, _dummy_,
<ce>                    in __location_, a city not even =timer_ days journey
<ce>                    %di from here. You must get the _package_ there in
<ce>                    time for it to help our allies. My council believes
<ce>                    that %reg's rivals will stand between you and
<ce>                    our allies' contact. I cannot be sure this is true, but I
<ce>                    would advise vigilance nevertheless. If you can make this
<ce>                    delivery to _location_ in __location_
<ce>                    on time, our allies will pay you _reward_ gold. I and all
<ce>                    %cn will be relying on you. Move quickly, take care
<ce>                    of yourself, and good luck be yours.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                    You must be %pcn, I am from your liege's allies,
<ce>                    sent to pick up the package from you. I'm glad
<ce>                    you found _location_ on time. Here is
<ce>                    your _reward_ gold pieces award.
<--->
<ce>                    My client, the council of your %rt's allies
<ce>                    is very anxious to get their hands on that
<ce>                    package, and they will be so pleased that you
<ce>                    delivered it on time. Please, accept these
<ce>                    _reward_ gold as a humble token of our esteem.
<ce>                    Now, I must be off. Goodbye.
<--->
<ce>                    Ah, we were afraid you wouldn't be able to find
<ce>                    _location_ in time. My client will be
<ce>                    so relieved to get this package, and you will
<ce>                    not be forgotten, my good %ra. Here's
<ce>                    _reward_ gold pieces, as promised. Thank you
<ce>                    and goodbye.

RumorsDuringQuest:   [1005]
I'll ask around, but I haven't heard anything lately that would interest you.
<--->
I do not want to sound paranoid, but I am convinced that our %t has been possessed by the daedra.
<--->
This city is crawling with undead after dark. Be armed at all times!
<--->
I do not have any proof of this, but you must believe me. I know the %t is an imposter. Not only that, %rn's a cannibal too.

RumorsPostSuccess:   [1007]
Well, I heard %reg's allies recently received a package from _questgiver_. Very mysterious, indeed.
<--->
Some of us are trying to make sense of a certain shipment that the %rt's allies received recently. A few are saying it came from a representative in __location_, but we all know that's impossible.
<--->
The council of one of %reg's allies is furious because it turns out they received and even paid for a forged relic from the Lord of ___questgiver_. I'd hate to see the deliverer once they find him.

<--->
The Baron of ___questgiver_ apparently sent a package to one of his allies in __location_. Nobody, except the its representative obviously, knows why, and most everyone is concerned.

The Baroness of ___questgiver_ apparently sent a package to one of her allies in __location_. Nobody, except the its representative obviously, knows why, and most everyone is concerned.
<--->
Apparently some %ra smuggler managed to get some contraband into __location_ from ___questgiver_, into the hands of one of %reg's allies. I sure hope they work on security in this city.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
<ce>            Yes, %pcn. I remember your service to the crown of %reg. Our allies send their thanks.

I have promised _questgiver_ in ___questgiver_ to
deliver a small sack to _dummy_, a
representative of %reg's allies in
__location_. My contact is in
_location_. _questgiver_ believes
agents working for %g3 rivals may try to stop me.
I have =timer_ days to deliver the item.

Message: 1020
<ce>                    Your inventory feels somewhat lighter. Apparently,
<ce>                    some kind pickpocket has relieved you of some of
<ce>                    your burden. After checking, you notice the package
<ce>                    for _dummy_ is missing.
<--->
<ce>                    _dummy_ should have received the package
<ce>                    by now. Knowing you won't get a gold piece for
<ce>                    it, you toss it away.

Message: 1030
<ce>                    These fighters were obviously sent by
<ce>                    %reg's enemies to stop you, for their
<ce>                    family colors are borne with pride.
<--->
<ce>                    The group blocking your path is at the
<ce>                    service of another. One of
<ce>                    %reg's enemies seem the obvious
<ce>                    master, if they truly wish for your
<ce>                    quest to fail.
<--->
<ce>                    The colors borne by this hostile group
<ce>                    are those of %reg's enemies.
<ce>                    It would seem the rumors of their
<ce>                    interest in aborting your quest are true.
<--->
<ce>                    The occasional wandering band is not an
<ce>                    unusual sight, but one bearing the colors
<ce>                    of %reg's enemies is strange
<ce>                    indeed. It is evident that they really
<ce>                    must want you dead.
<--->
<ce>                    You might assume this to be a chance
<ce>                    encounter with a hostile warrior, but not
<ce>                    one carrying the colors of
<ce>                    %reg's enemies. The rumors of
<ce>                    their involvment in you quest are apparently
<ce>                    true.

Message: 1040
<ce>                    I received word from our allies that there
<ce>                    was no shipment of that package. It was
<ce>                    extremely embarrassing for me. They thought
<ce>                    I would choose someone capable of such a
<ce>                    delivery. It shows a bit of nerve for you
<ce>                    to come back to my court, unsuccessful in
<ce>                    your quest. You are not expecting payment
<ce>                    from me surely? Now, please go. Leave my
<ce>                    sight.
<--->
<ce>                    Your timing could not be better. Our allies'
<ce>                    messenger just informed me that you never
<ce>                    managed to get the package to _dummy_.
<ce>                    I wish you had told me you were not skilled
<ce>                    enough to complete the quest before you
<ce>                    accepted it. Begone, cretinous orc-vomit.
<--->
<ce>                    I have to say I admire your courage, %ra.
<ce>                    Not many would return to the palace where they
<ce>                    received instructions they could not follow.
<ce>                    Yes, I have already heard that you were not
<ce>                    able to get my package to _dummy_.
<ce>                    Ah well, it was probably too much for someone
<ce>                    with your limited experience. You may leave
<ce>                    in dishonor, but in peace.
