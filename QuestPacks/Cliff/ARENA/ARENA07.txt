<ce>                    Good day to you. I need your assistance.
<ce>                    Would you slay a monster for me?
<--->
<ce>                    I am looking for someone who would slay
<ce>                    a beast for our %rt. Nothing could
<ce>                    be simpler. Give me your allegiance on
<ce>                    this matter and I will make you a rich
<ce>                    person. Perhaps you would like me to
<ce>                    describe the situation in more depth?
<--->
<ce>                    Welcome, %pcn to %cn. It is an
<ce>                    opportune moment for you to arrive, for I was
<ce>                    just telling my advisors last night I need
<ce>                    someone to slay a monster for me. You will,
<ce>                    of course, be generously rewarded. Shall I
<ce>                    tell you more about it?


RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                    I understand. There would be some risks in
<ce>                    accepting my quest and that naturally makes
<ce>                    you nervous. Very well, %ra. You will
<ce>                    forgive me if I do not walk you to the door.
<ce>                    Goodbye.
<--->
<ce>                    What a pity. I will have to find another
<ce>                    champion. Good day, %pcn.
<ce>                    I wish you well.
<--->
<ce>                    Well, I am not particularly surprised that you
<ce>                    refuse this possible adventure, for I have
<ce>                    heard that young %ra people like you are
<ce>                    notoriously unambitious. I hope you are able to
<ce>                    do something of some value elsewhere.
<ce>                    Leave me now.
<--->
<ce>                    Very well, I cannot force you to accept my plea.
<ce>                    I hope all goes well on your travels, and you
<ce>                    return to %cn someday. Now, you may go.
<ce>                    I will find someone else eager to help the %rt
<ce>                    and become rich. Fare you well.
<--->
<ce>                    I am disappointed, but I understand that a young
<ce>                    adventurer's schedule is hard to break. I see
<ce>                    you are doing well now. I hope good fortune
<ce>                    smiles upon your efforts...
<--->
<ce>                    I suppose I cannot talk you into it. Perhaps
<ce>                    there is another who will accept the risks
<ce>                    in return for wealth and fame. Farewell, %ra.
<--->
<ce>                    I had hoped you would be interested but there
<ce>                    are others who would gladly welcome the chance
<ce>                    to fill their purses. I thank you but must
<ce>                    turn my attention to other matters. Good luck
<ce>                    on your travels.
<--->
<ce>                    You would deny a pleading member of the
<ce>                    %reg royal family a small request such
<ce>                    as this! Away with you then, for I have
<ce>                    more important matters to consider than
<ce>                    some amateur %ra adventurer. Begone! 

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                    Then you shall be my champion, %pcn. My birthday
<ce>                    is coming in =timer_ days, and, as if in mockery,
<ce>                    =monster1_ has come to my lands to feed. It has
<ce>                    slain all the hunters I have sent after it, but
<ce>                    word has come that its lair is known as
<ce>                    ___location_. You must go there and kill it
<ce>                    for me. If =monster1_ is alive to devour my people
<ce>                    come my birthday, the cost in human life and the
<ce>                    loss of holiday revenue will be astronomical. I
<ce>                    offer you _reward_ gold for the death of that beast.
<ce>                    Be careful, %ra, and good luck.   
<--->
<ce>                    I am happy to make you my champion, %pcn, but
<ce>                    I will be happier still when this business is behind
<ce>                    us. =monster1_ has fallen upon my lands like a plague.
<ce>                    In the past, =monster1_ has has terrorized the largest
<ce>                    City-states and the humblest villages in the province,
<ce>                    but I want its life to end here, in its lair known as
<ce>                    ___location_. Kill it in =timer_ days,
<ce>                    or it will feed on the people celebrating my annual
<ce>                    festival. Imagine the political embarrassment. For a
<ce>                    reward of _reward_ gold, we shall see if you are you
<ce>                    strong enough to challenge =monster1_.
<ce>                    Thank you, %ra, and good luck.
<--->
<ce>                    Excellent, %pcn, you are brave indeed. My lands are
<ce>                    being stalked by a deadly foe, one which has evaded my hunters
<ce>                    for weeks. Locals have called it =monster1_ and its lair is in
<ce>                    ___location_. I will pay you _reward_ gold if you would
<ce>                    find it and kill it before it does anymore harm to my people.
<ce>                    The monster must be dead before =timer_ days, for I hold my
<ce>                    cousin's wedding then and would have people not fear to come
<ce>                    out of their homes. Move quickly, take care of yourself, and
<ce>                    good luck be yours, %ra.

<ce>                    Is =monster1_ dead at last? No other city in the region was
<ce>                    able to defeat this monster, but thanks to you, %cn will
<ce>                    be called the city that slew =monster1_. You have certainly
<ce>                    earned your reward, good %ra. Take it and go in peace.
<--->
<ce>                    You do not even have to tell me that the fearsome monster is
<ce>                    dead. Word has spread quickly. Already there are ballads
<ce>                    being written about how the brave %ra slew =monster1_,
<ce>                    scourge of %cn. Of course, fame alone cannot keep you fed,
<ce>                    so here is the _reward_ gold pieces I promised you. Good luck
<ce>                    and come back to our city anytime.
<--->
<ce>                    Even before you arrived, I heard from the peasants outside
<ce>                    that =monster1_ was dead, slain by a valiant %ra. You
<ce>                    have earned your septims and a place in the history of
<ce>                    %cn, if not the whole region. The %rt and people of
<ce>                    %cn thanks you.

RumorsDuringQuest:   [1005]
Rumor has it there is a plague in Skyrim.
<--->
My aunt just returned from a little village on the edge of Elsweyr that has been almost completely ravaged by a plague.
<--->
The prophet I see tells me that Hammerfell will be decimated by the plague early next year.

RumorsPostSuccess:   [1007]
Did you hear that some %ra kid killed the beast known as =monster1_? Makes you think anything is possible, doesn't it?
<--->
That monster that plagued ___questgiver_ is finally dead. We should be dancing in the streets!
<--->
The best huntsmen of the %t couldn't slay =monster1_, so _questgiver_ hired someone who I hear is half %ra and half giant and now the monster's dead! Talk about fighting fire with fire!
<--->
Have you heard about the %ra that killed the monster, =monster1_? Apparently this %ra was really a demigod, and sprouted wings and flew away! I have it on good authority.
<--->
Everyone in town in celebrating the death of =monster1_. We owe it all to a mysterious %ra who didn't even leave a name. Well, we'll never forget %pg2.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
<ce>            =monster1_'s slayer! The roads in %cn's area have been safer since your brave deed.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>            I did not require you to bring me the head of =monster1_: I would have originally believed that the monster was dead. But I only just heard that a farmer right outside my city was murdered by =monster1_. I must send someone else to rid my lands from this menace. Leave me now.

<--->
<ce>            I told you to slay the beast =monster1_ in =timer_ days if you recall.
<ce>            I had expected more from an experienced %ra like you than my own
<ce>            hunters. It would appears I was wrong. Begone, you will get no reward
<ce>            from me.
<--->
<ce>            Well, =monster1_ did not attack my celebration as expected, but only
<ce>            because it moved elsewhere in the region. As for you, you couldn't
<ce>            slay a goblin grub. Do not expect any reward from me. Off with you,
<ce>            %ra.
