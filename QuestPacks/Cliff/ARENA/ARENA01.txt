QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                    I need your help. If my
<ce>                    delivery doesn't make it in
<ce>                    time, I'll be in trouble. 
<ce>                    Can you help me? I'm desperate.
<--->
<ce>                    Greetings, I've been informed
<ce>                    of your presence in town. They
<ce>                    tell me you're called %pcn.
<ce>                    If you're as tough as you look,
<ce>                    I know a way for you to get a
<ce>                    quick amount of gold. I need
<ce>                    something delivered so, do we
<ce>                    got a deal?
<--->
<ce>                    Lend me your ear for a moment, %ra.
<ce>                    For reasons of utmost importance to
<ce>                    the welfare of %cn, it is
<ce>                    imperative that I have this packaged
<ce>                    delivered. Will you help me and
<ce>                    %cn?

<ce>                    Won't even consider it, eh? To be
<ce>                    expected, I suppose. I've always heard
<ce>                    that your typical %ra is a lazy,
<ce>                    stupid, stinking pile of Orc dung. No
<ce>                    hard feelings.
<--->
<ce>                    I understand. Thanks anyway. And, by the
<ce>                    way, if you tell anyone what I just told
<ce>                    you, I'll pull your teeth out by way of
<ce>                    your neck. Have a nice day.
<--->
<ce>                    Really? You won't help me? Then do me one
<ce>                    favor: don't let anyone know what I talked
<ce>                    to you about. Goodbye

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                    Thank you, %pcn. My mind is much eased.
<ce>                    If this sack isn't at _location_
<ce>                    in __location_ in =timer_ days,
<ce>                    my life ain't going to be worth a copper.
<ce>                    _dummy_'ll be there to take the
<ce>                    sack if you're there on time, and I'm sure
<ce>                    %g'll give you _reward_ gold for it.
<ce>                    Good luck to you, good %ra.
<--->
<ce>                    %god, the good spirits must have delivered
<ce>                    you indeed. This sack I have was supposed to
<ce>                    be at _location_ in __location_
<ce>                    days ago and if it ain't there by =timer_ days,
<ce>                    things could get real nasty. _dummy_
<ce>                    there will pay you _reward_ drakes if you're at
<ce>                    _location_ in time. I'm relying on you, %pcn,
<ce>                    do not let me down.
<--->
<ce>                    You are my savior, good %ra. Take this sack
<ce>                    and take it to _location_ in __location_
<ce>                    before =timer_ days. I have a contact there,
<ce>                    _dummy_, who will give you
<ce>                    _reward_ septims if you can make it in time. 
<ce>                    Goodbye and good luck.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                    Ah, I had heard _questgiver_ had sent you on
<ce>                    this errand. Glad to see you made it on time with
<ce>                    the package. Here are your _reward_ gold. Thank you.
<--->
<ce>                    What a marvelous package, and it's even here on time.
<ce>                    Quite unlike _questgiver_ to be so punctual,
<ce>                    I assure you. Well, enjoy your _reward_ gold reward.
<ce>                    You've earned it.
<--->
<ce>                    I've been expecting you and the package but I can tell
<ce>                    you now I hadn't expected you to arrive on time. Good
<ce>                    speed. I believe _reward_ septims was the amount agreed on?

RumorsDuringQuest:   [1005]
Nothing much is going on, as far as I know.
<--->
You're probably asking the wrong person. I haven't heard anything interesting.
<--->
I'm sure I haven't heard anything you'd care about.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
<ce>            My favorite courier! How can I help?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>            Your failure to deliver my package costed me dearly. You should know that.

Message: 1010
<ce>%qdt
_questgiver_ in ___questgiver_ hired me to
deliver a _package_ to _dummy_ who can be
found at the _location_ in
__location_. _questgiver_ expects
me to make the delivery in =timer_ days or less.

Message: 1020
<ce>                    Your inventory feels somewhat lighter. Apparently,
<ce>                    some kind pickpocket has relieved you of some of
<ce>                    your burden. After checking, you notice the
<ce>                    package for _dummy_ is missing.
<--->
<ce>                    _dummy_ should have received the
<ce>                    package by now. Knowing you won't get a gold piece
<ce>                    for it, you toss it away
