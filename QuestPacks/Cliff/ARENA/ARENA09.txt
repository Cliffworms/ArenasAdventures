<ce>                    Ah, you're %pcn. I will speak with you, for
<ce>                    my city needs help. We must rescue a relative of mine.
<ce>                    I have heard you have sufficient experience. Are you
<ce>                    interested?
<--->
<ce>                    I bid you welcome to our city, %pcn. I need a
<ce>                    person who can rescue someone close to me, held prisoner
<ce>                    in a terrible dungeon. In return, you will be rewarded
<ce>                    beyond your most avaricious dreams. Do we have a deal?
<--->
<ce>                    I hope you are looking for work because I need to find
<ce>                    someone who can do the job right. I am a generous
<ce>                    noble, and you will be more than fairly paid if you
<ce>                    would rescue a relative of mine. Will you help me?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                    I understand. There would be some risks in
<ce>                    accepting my quest and that naturally makes
<ce>                    you nervous. Very well, %ra. You will
<ce>                    forgive me if I do not walk you to the door.
<ce>                    Goodbye.
<--->
<ce>                    What a pity. I will have to find another
<ce>                    champion. Good day, %pcn.
<ce>                    I wish you well.
<--->
<ce>                    Well, I am not particularly surprised that you
<ce>                    refuse this possible adventure, for I have
<ce>                    heard that young %ra people like you are
<ce>                    notoriously unambitious. I hope you are able to
<ce>                    do something of some value elsewhere.
<ce>                    Leave me now.
<--->
<ce>                    Very well, I cannot force you to accept my plea.
<ce>                    I hope all goes well on your travels, and you
<ce>                    return to %cn someday. Now, you may go.
<ce>                    I will find someone else eager to help the %rt
<ce>                    and become rich. Fare you well.
<--->
<ce>                    I am disappointed, but I understand that a young
<ce>                    adventurer's schedule is hard to break. I see
<ce>                    you are doing well now. I hope good fortune
<ce>                    smiles upon your efforts...
<--->
<ce>                    I suppose I cannot talk you into it. Perhaps
<ce>                    there is another who will accept the risks
<ce>                    in return for wealth and fame. Farewell, %ra.
<--->
<ce>                    I had hoped you would be interested but there
<ce>                    are others who would gladly welcome the chance
<ce>                    to fill their purses. I thank you but must
<ce>                    turn my attention to other matters. Good luck
<ce>                    on your travels.
<--->
<ce>                    You would deny a pleading member of the
<ce>                    %reg royal family a small request such
<ce>                    as this! Away with you then, for I have
<ce>                    more important matters to consider than
<ce>                    some amateur %ra adventurer. Begone! 

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                    A terrible fate has befallen _dummy_, a close relative.
<ce>                    I think %g has been taken by one of %reg's
<ce>                    enemies and secreted in a dungeon in the region. The
<ce>                    place's name is ___location_. Should you
<ce>                    save my relative, I will reward you with _reward_ gold.
<ce>                    Be careful however, I'm sure that _dummy_'s captors
<ce>                    will try and stop you. You must have %g2 back before
<ce>                    =timer_ days have passed, or my people will notice %g3
<ce>                    absence. I cannot allow that. Hurry, and good luck!
<--->
<ce>                    _dummy_, my beloved cousin's child, a gentle soul
<ce>                    unused to the cruelties of the world, has
<ce>                    disappeared. I know that the forces of a neighboring
<ce>                    region are responsible, and my poor relative is
<ce>                    probably in ___location_, a dungeon in
<ce>                    the region. This affair could not have happened at a
<ce>                    worse time. You see, %g is due to be married to an
<ce>                    important political ally in =timer_ days. I must have
<ce>                    _dummy_ back by then or there will be chaos. It will
<ce>                    not be easy for you to get back in time, for even if
<ce>                    my enemies know not of my intentions of rescue,
<ce>                    ___location_ is notoriously well-defended.
<ce>                    You shall be paid _reward_ gold for the child's safe
<ce>                    return. Akatosh's speed, %ra.
<--->
<ce>                    _dummy_, my cousin's child, missing for days, has
<ce>                    finally been located in the infernal pit known as
<ce>                    ___location_. I think %g is the prisoner of a rival
<ce>                    of mine there. I need you to use your every talent
<ce>                    to complete the rescue in no more than =timer_ days.
<ce>                    After that I will send someone else and your reward
<ce>                    of _reward_ gold will be forfeit. I take it you realize
<ce>                    the strength of my rival and you feel you are capable?
<ce>                    Of course you do. Save _dummy_, %ra.
<ce>                    The Divines be with you.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                    _dummy_, my beloved cousin's child, free at last
<ce>                    from %reg's enemies. Good %pcf, you have made
<ce>                    my heart glad indeed. Here are _reward_ gold pieces,
<ce>                    as I promised. May %god smile upon you and grant
<ce>                    you happiness.
<--->
<ce>                    You have rescued my cousin's child from %reg's enemies,
<ce>                    and my gratitude to you is enormous. Please accept the
<ce>                    _reward_ gold pieces as a token of the debt I owe.
<ce>                    Good luck in your travels. You will be remembered
<ce>                    in %cn.
<--->
<ce>                    My heart is full of gratitude to you. I feared I would never see
<ce>                    my cousin's child again. In addition to your reward of _reward_ gold,
<ce>                    I have ordered my scribes to write you into the tomes of %cn,
<ce>                    so you will never be forgotten. Bless you, good %ra.

RumorsDuringQuest:   [1005]
I heard that some lord in a village angered his patron spirit this week. The local shaman forsees a plague over all the province within the month.
<--->
They say Morrowind is doomed to wither away from plague and pestilence this year or next. My opinion is good riddance.
<--->
Some friends of mine went out searching for the Staff of Magnus, but they disappeared. The fools.

RumorsPostSuccess:   [1007]
Did you know %reg's enemies kidnapped the child of _questgiver_'s cousin? _dummy_'s back in ___questgiver_ now, but apparently the child was gone for weeks! Can you believe they kept that a secret?
<--->
Big scandal at the palace, young %ra. It seems a close relative of ___questgiver_'s ruler had been kidnapped, for weeks maybe, and the _questgiver_ did nothing but send some mercenary after the kid. Can you imagine?
<--->
Apparently, the ruler of ___questgiver_'s cousin or child or something is back from ___location_, some health spa in the country. They say the relative's lost a lot of weight. That's good, I suppose.
<--->
Some %ra rescued the child of _questgiver_'s cousin from some horrible place called ___location_. No one in town even realized _dummy_ was gone, let alone kidnapped by %reg's enemies . Weird, eh?
<--->
Listen to this. Some relative of ___questgiver_'s noble family was kidnapped by %reg's enemies  and imprisoned in ___location_ and what does that ruler do? Orders some poor, stupid %ra kid to get the relative back. The palace's in an uproar.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
<ce>            My noble family shall never forget your brave rescue of _dummy_. Ask, and I shall answer.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>            When I saw my dear _dummy_ walk out of the wilderness and through the city gates, I ran to ask where you were, you who had rescued %g2. Imagine my surprise when %g said %g had never seen you at all, let alone been rescued by you. That constitutes mission failure, young %ra. Pathetic.


Message: 1010
<ce>%qdt
I have been hired by _questgiver_, a noble from
___questgiver_'s palace, to rescue _dummy_ who
is imprisoned in ___location_.
I must bring %g2 in ___questgiver_ in
=timer_ days to earn the _reward_ gold reward.

Message: 1020
<ce>            _dummy_ thanks you for your assistance and leaves you,
<ce>            figuring %g has a better chance making it to ___questgiver_
<ce>            alone.

Message: 1025
<ce>            It has been more than =timer_ days since you were hired
<ce>            to rescue _dummy_ from ___location_.
<ce>            By now, the child of _questgiver_'s cousin is
<ce>            probably dead, lost or moved somewhere else.

Message: 1030
<ce>            Ah, good to see you again, %pcn. Are you well? My dear
<ce>            _dummy_ is grateful for the meager assistance you gave
<ce>            %g2 in escaping ___location_. You know %g returned to
<ce>            my palace only hours ago, of course. Had you returned
<ce>            my cousin's child yourself, I would have given you
<ce>            your reward. As it is, that would be absurd. Farewell.
<--->
<ce>            Interesting rescuing procedure. My cousin's child arrived
<ce>            a little while ago, worn and bedraggled from a long
<ce>            journey by foot. I cannot say that you did nothing to
<ce>            rescue _dummy_, but obviously not enough to merit your
<ce>            reward. Be off with you.
<--->
<ce>            When I saw my dear _dummy_ walk out of the wilderness and
<ce>            through the city gates, I ran to ask where you were, you
<ce>            who had rescued %g2. Imagine my surprise when %g said %g
<ce>            had never seen you at all, let alone been rescued by you.
<ce>            That constitutes mission failure, young %ra, and that
<ce>            means no reward. Goodbye.

Message: 1040
<ce>            %oth, a rescuer from _questgiver_! Hurry,
<ce>            I must be home in ___questgiver_ as soon as possible!

Message: 1050
<ce>                    These fighters were obviously sent by
<ce>                    %reg's enemies to stop you, for their
<ce>                    family colors are borne with pride.
<--->
<ce>                    The group blocking your path is at the
<ce>                    service of another. One of
<ce>                    %reg's enemies seem the obvious
<ce>                    master, if they truly wish for your
<ce>                    quest to fail.
<--->
<ce>                    The colors borne by this hostile group
<ce>                    are those of %reg's enemies.
<ce>                    It would seem the rumors of their
<ce>                    interest in aborting your quest are true.
<--->
<ce>                    The occasional wandering band is not an
<ce>                    unusual sight, but one bearing the colors
<ce>                    of %reg's enemies is strange
<ce>                    indeed. It is evident that they really
<ce>                    must want you dead.
<--->
<ce>                    You might assume this to be a chance
<ce>                    encounter with a hostile warrior, but not
<ce>                    one carrying the colors of
<ce>                    %reg's enemies. The rumors of
<ce>                    their involvment in you quest are apparently
<ce>                    true.
