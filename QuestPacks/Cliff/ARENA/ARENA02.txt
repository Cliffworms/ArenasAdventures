<ce>                    You have a kindly face, %ra,
<ce>                    and I need a friend. I loaned
<ce>                    something to someone and I need it
<ce>                    back. Would you get it for me?
<--->
<ce>                    I need help, young %ra. I need
<ce>                    someone discreet who can go get something
<ce>                    somewhere and bring it here.
<ce>                    Unfortunately, I cannot get the object
<ce>                    myself. Care to help? You'll be paid
<ce>                    accordingly.
<--->
<ce>                    Good %ra, if you could use some gold,
<ce>                    hear me out. There is a certain person who
<ce>                    has something of my liege's. Would you get
<ce>                    it for me? You would have my gratitude and
<ce>                    gold, as I said.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                    Won't even consider it, eh? To be
<ce>                    expected, I suppose. I've always heard
<ce>                    that your typical %ra is a lazy,
<ce>                    stupid, stinking pile of Orc dung. No
<ce>                    hard feelings.
<--->
<ce>                    I understand. Thanks anyway. And, by the
<ce>                    way, if you tell anyone what I just told
<ce>                    you, I'll pull your teeth out by way of
<ce>                    your neck. Have a nice day.
<--->
<ce>                    Really? You won't help me? Then do me one
<ce>                    favor: don't let anyone know what I talked
<ce>                    to you about. Goodbye

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                    Thank you, %pcn. My mind is much eased.
<ce>                    You see, I loaned a book of sentimental value to
<ce>                    to _dummy_ in __location_ and now 
<ce>                    must have it back. I'd be happy to give you _reward_ gold
<ce>                    for its safe return, but I must have _package_
<ce>                    in =timer_ days or less. Good luck to you, good %ra.
<--->
<ce>                    %god, the good spirits must have delivered
<ce>                    you indeed. As I said, I am supposed to get a book
<ce>                    named _package_ from an agent of mine
<ce>                    in __location_. Ask for _dummy_ there.
<ce>                    If I don't have it in =timer_ days I will lose a great deal
<ce>                    of money. I will give you _reward_ septims if you get me
<ce>                    the book in time. I'm relying on you, %pcn,
<ce>                    do not let me down.
<--->
<ce>                    You are my savior, good %ra. I loaned this book,
<ce>                    _package_,  a few weeks ago to _dummy_
<ce>                    in __location_, and now I've discovered my
<ce>                    liege is returning to %cn early, in =timer_ days.
<ce>                    I will pay you _reward_ drakes on arrival with the book.
<ce>                    Goodbye and good luck.

<ce>                    The %ra returns with my book! You don't know
<ce>                    how nervous I was, fearful you wouldn't be able
<ce>                    to find __location_ or get back here in time.
<ce>                    You have certainly deserved your _reward_ gold
<ce>                    pieces. I owe you more than you will ever know.
<ce>                    Thank you, good %ra.
<--->
<ce>                    Excellent job, I knew you were the right
<ce>                    %ra for the errand the moment I saw you
<ce>                    in here. I wish I could give you more than these
<ce>                    _reward_ drakes. Good luck, good adventurer,
<ce>                    and know that someone in %cn is forever
<ce>                    grateful to you.
<--->
<ce>                    I heard you had picked the book from
<ce>                    __location_ but I must admit I feared
<ce>                    you wouldn't get it back here on time. As
<ce>                    promised, here are your _reward_ gold. I'm
<ce>                    very grateful. Thank you, noble %ra.

RumorsDuringQuest:   [1005]
Sorry, I wish I had something to say but I don't.
<--->
Well, nothing much is going on, near as I can tell you.
<--->
Nothing I can say. %cn's been pretty quiet actually.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
<ce>            Good to see you, %pcf. I was just talking about you to a friend about how efficient you are.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>            %oth! What do you want, %pcf? Your failure costed me dearly. You should know that.

_questgiver_ in ___questgiver_ hired me
to retrieve a book, _package_ from
_dummy_ who can be found in
__location_. _questgiver_ expects
me to return in =timer_ days or less.

Message: 1020
<ce>                    You're here for _package_, am I right?
<ce>                    Here it is. Tell _questgiver_
<ce>                    I said thank you.
<--->
<ce>                    Here's the book that _questgiver_
<ce>                    needs. You'd better be on your way back
<ce>                    to %g2 now.
<--->
<ce>                    _questgiver_ sent you for the book?
<ce>                    Damn, I could've used it. Well, hurry back
<ce>                    to %g2.

Message: 1030
<ce>                    _questgiver_ should have received
<ce>                    _package_ by now. Knowing you won't
<ce>                    get a gold piece for it, you decide
<ce>                    to continue on your way.
