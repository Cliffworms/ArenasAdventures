==============
1. DESCRIPTION
==============

Arena's Adventures brings the 9 sides quests from Elder Scrolls I : Arena to Daggerfall's pool of quests for commoners and nobles.
The commoners receive 3 quests and the nobles receive 6. 

While simple in mechanics, the charm of Arena's quests is in the writing. 

Note : One of the noble quests involve fighting either the Thieves Guild or the Dark Brotherhood. Feel free to decline it
if you don't want a big reputation hit with those two factions.


===============
